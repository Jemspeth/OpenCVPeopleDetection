People Detection

We gon' detect the shit out some ppl

Found the HOGCascade.cpp and HOGCascade.hpp on Github so we can use it on opencv3. Feel free to add a file with the video stuff you figured out and we can try to work it in with this other shit. I'm going to try to mess around with the HOG.cpp file for now and try to get it somewhat close to working. Cheers!
